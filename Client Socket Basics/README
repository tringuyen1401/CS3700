When starting out this project, we decided the first thing we should be researching is how to connect to the server using a socket before starting on anything else. Turns out there is a built in python package called socket, that allows us to create a socket and connect that socket to the server. Once there we just sent the necessary message to receive the STATUS messages. We then continuous looped through those messages, solving each equation, until finally reaching the BYE message with our attached secret flag. Very few challenges were faced other than how to parse through the STATUS messages to solve the equations effectively.

We then implement the SSL base on the socket.ssl() function, since all the required fields are automatically resolved by the ssl() function, it is quite easy to implement the ssl connection. The only different thing is that we have to code addition if statement to detect whether the connection is ssl or not to use the according code used for sending and receiving.

To test our code we had statements print out the information we found important on each step along the way. We had a fully fleshed out idea of what we wanted to do, so we just had to make sure that each part was working as intended, until finally reaching the BYE statement where we got our secret flag, letting us know we had succeeded.
